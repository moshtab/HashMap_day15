# HashMap_day15

uc1 :-Ability to find frequency of words in a sentence like “To be or not to be”

 - Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation

 - To do this we create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode

uc2 :-Ability to find frequency of words in a large paragraph phrase “Paranoids are not paranoid because they are paranoid but because they keep putting themselves deliberately into paranoid avoidable situations”

 - Use hashcode to find index of the words in the para

 - Create LinkedList for each index and store the words and its frequency

 - Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation

 - To do this create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode
 
 uc3 :- Remove avoidable word from the phrase “Paranoids are not paranoid because they are paranoid but because they keep putting themselves deliberately into paranoid avoidable situations”

 - Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation like here the removal of word avoidable

 - To do this create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode
